#### Production Timeline Matrix
| Production Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables | Quality Gates | Success Metrics |
|------------------|----------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-Production** | 20% of timeline | Concept, script, resource plan | Creative approval, feasibility confirmation | 95%+ stakeholder alignment |
| **Active Production** | 60% of timeline | Content creation, initial quality control | Milestone reviews, quality standards | 90%+ quality maintenance |
| **Post-Production** | 15% of timeline | Final content, optimization, distribution prep | Final approval, delivery confirmation | 94%+ delivery quality |
| **Archive & Analysis** | 5% of timeline | Performance analysis, knowledge capture | Success validation, learning integration | 85%+ objective achievement |
