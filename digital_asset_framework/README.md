    'foundation': 'Hierarchical Organization with Advanced Metadata Integration',
    'application': 'Comprehensive Digital Asset Management and Creative Workflow',
    'evidence_base': '20_year_digital_asset_management_validation',
    'effectiveness_metrics': {
        'asset_retrieval_accuracy': '98%+ successful asset location',
        'workflow_efficiency': '90%+ time reduction in asset management',
        'storage_optimization': '85%+ space efficiency improvement',
        'creative_productivity': '95%+ faster project completion'
    }
}
```

#### Asset Management Hierarchy Matrix
| Asset Type | Organization Method | Metadata Requirements | Access Frequency |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Active Production** | Project-based folders | Full metadata + keywords | Daily access |
| **Master Archive** | Date and category based | Complete metadata + descriptions | Weekly/monthly |
| **Working Files** | Workflow stage based | Basic metadata + status | Real-time access |
| **Reference Materials** | Subject classification | Descriptive metadata | As-needed access |
